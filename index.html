      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My mission is to be a catalyst for growth, transformation, and perseverance in both myself and others through
        relationships and collaborative work. ‚≠êÔ∏è
      </p>
      <p>I am passionate about leveraging web development to solve real human needs. üíª</p>
      <p>
        I have managed, lead, coached, and taught in some capacity as a professional for almost two decades, and have
        been working with technology just as long!
      </p>
      <p>
        Two things in life fill me with joy and fulfillment - seeing someone grow into the best version of themselves,
        and solving a problem creatively using a technological solution. ü§ü
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone were to describe my greatest strengths, they would be connecting with others, listening, and asking
        questions, as well as finding creative, novel approaches to problem-solving.
      </p>

      <p>
        My professional journey has taken me through a diverse set of fields: retail, service industry, construction,
        the United States Air Force (where I served for nearly 9 years and deployed in support of Operation Iraqi
        Freedom multiple times), management, and coaching.
